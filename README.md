# Presrequests
* Make sure docker and doker-compose is installed in your machine.
* Make sure python3.6 is installed.

# Installation
* navigate to your directory where you want the project folder to be.
* create a virtual environment using the following command
```shell
$ python3 -m venv oculyze
```
* navigate to oculyze directory
```shell 
$ cd oculyze
```
* activate the virtual environment
```shell
$ source bin/activate
```
* clone the project from the repo using the following command
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/azizcruz/test_project.git
```
* when the project is cloned navigate to the directory
```shell 
$ cd test_project
```
* build the containers using docker-compose
```shell
$ docker-compose build 
```
this step may take some time to finish.
* when it is finished start the containers using

now both of the services are running and connected to a private network named test_project_private-net using docker bridge networks.
